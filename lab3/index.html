	<h1> Lab 3 - File Structure </h1>
	<p> The purpose of this lab was to have the students organzine their files for more
		 organization and how to be able to connect file to file.</p>

	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> In organizing the files, it came very natural to me. But when trying to add photos
	 under my lab 3 folder was a little difficult. But other than that, it went pretty
	  smoothly. </p>

	<h3> Results </h3>
	<p> All was done smoothly and I created screenshots to add to my partner's and I pdf. </p>
