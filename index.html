			<h1> About Me </h1>
			<img src="img/rmaeder.jpg" width="300" />
			<p> Hello, my name is Ross Maeder and I am the coder for this website. I live
			 in Orange County, CA and I attend CSUMB. I have no experience in coding,
			 but excited and eager to learn about it. I feel like this is an import skill
			 to learn, especially in our technologically advanced world today. My hobbies
			  include drawing, playing vodep games, working out, and fashion. </p>

				<p> My interests, when it comes to gaming, is either Call of Duty or Rocket League.
			 I usually play on Xbox and with friends most of the time. I would like to excel
			 my talents in gaming to either be streaming or playing professionally. The next step
			 to this would be buying a PC, since the frame rate and basically everything else is
			 a lot lower on console. </p>
