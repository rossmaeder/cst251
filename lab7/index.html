      <h1> Challenge </h1>
        <p> The challenge of this lab is to understand and learn the ropes of CSS.
          This is one of the early lessons to kickstart CSS as a whole. </p>
      <h1> Problems </h1>
        <p> There was a huge problem for me when creating the lab7 folder and its files.
          And this was a real test with CSS, so it was just an overall challenge learing
          the concepts. </p>
      <h1> Results </h1>
        <p> This page of my webpage is the results. The change of color and creativity
          are included. </p>
