	<h1> The Lab </h1>
		<p> The subject of the lab is to assist with the uploading of files and testing
			 to see how amd if these files coexist and work on the webpage. </p>
	<h2> Difficulties </h2>
		<p> Mostly my difficulties or challeneges included the image process. Both trying
			to see if the the image even uploaded and the size of it. It is just hard for me
			to be able to size the image and position it on my page how it want. </p>
	<h3> Results </h3>
		<p> The results are what is on my custom homepage. From all the links, images,
			and text with little to no mispelling or errors. So far everything that is done,
			took time and effort and I am proud of what I have accomplished.
