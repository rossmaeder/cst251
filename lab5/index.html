	<h1> What is the point of Lab 5? </h1>
		<p> The main objective of Lab 5 was to get familiar with linking photos to websites.
			I am linking images that portray myself, from different websites. </p>
	<h2> Problems/Issues </h2>
		<p> This is my first time linking images to various websites, so it took a while
			to correct myself. It was hard physically finding the image and the correct url
			 for it, other than the whole website. </p>
	<h3> Results </h3>
		<p> On my webpage, you now see images to link of my personal life, hobbies, and things
			that are important to me. Hope these images spice up my webpage.
